								    <p><b><u>PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY</u></b></p>
								    <p>It defines the way nodes and links in a network are laid out physically.</p>
								    <p><b><u>1. Mesh Topology:</u></b></p>
								    <p>In this topology, every device has a dedicated point to point duplex link to every other device. Hence, as you might have guessed, mesh topology forms a complete graph.</p>
								    <center><img src="pic/topo.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"/></center>
								    <p><b>Q. What is the total number of links in a mesh topology with ‘n’ nodes?</b></p>
								    <p><b>Tip: </b>Think about the solution first, and think about more than one way to solve it. It will be mentioned specifically if a problem has more than one way to reach a solution.</p>

			       
								  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">See Solution</button><br/>
								  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
								  	<p><b>Approach 1- </b>Every node is connected with every other node; think about it as a way of selecting any two nodes, and having a link between them. Therefore,</p>
								  	<p>No. of links = nC2 = n(n-1) / 2</p>
								  	<p>[Remember, nCr = (n)! / (n-r)!(r)!]</p>
								  	<p><b>Approach 2-</b> Think about a party in which everybody shakes hands with everyone else, but only once. Now evaluate the total number of handshakes. If we consider the first person, he has to shake hands with n-1 others, the next person will have to shake hands with n-2 others, since he already shook hands with the first and so on.</p>
								  	<p>Therefore, total number of handshakes (total number of links as per analogy) will be,</p>
								  	<p>(n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + (n-4)………………+2 + 1 = n(n-1) / 2</p>
								  	<p>*Remember, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4……….n = n(n+1) / 2, replace n by n-1. (Arithmetic Progression)]</p>								    
								  </div><br/>

								  <p><b><u>Advantages of Mesh Topology:</u></b></p>
								  <p>•	Traffic problems are eliminated, since every 2 nodes have a dedicated point to point link.<br/>•	Mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not affect the entire system.<br/>

									•	There is privacy and security, since only the intended receiver is able to see the data.<br/>

									•	Point to point links makes fault isolation and fault identification easy.
									</p>

									<p><b><u>Disadvantages of Mesh Topology:</u></b></p>
									<p>
										•	Amount of cabling required is quite high. As we’ve seen n(n-1) / 2 dedicated links are required, which, in practice is a very high number.<br/>

											•	Number of I/O ports required is high as well.<br/>

											•	Installation and Reconnection are difficult.<br/>

											•	Hence, mesh topology becomes really expensive owing to the large number of hardware devices required to set it up.

									</p>
									<p>Therefore, mesh topology is used only in limited applications, generally implementation of LAN networks as they have less number of nodes and span less area.</p>

									<p><b><u>2. Star Topology:</u></b></p>

									<p>In this topology, every device has a dedicated point to point link to only a central system, called hub. The hub acts as a controller for exchange of data between the devices. If any device wants to send data to any other device the data goes through the hub to the receiving device.
									</p>
									<center><img src="pic/star.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"/></center>
									<p>Total number of links in star topology with ‘n’ nodes = n (One link to hub, for each node)</p>

									<p><b><u> Advantages of Star Topology:</u></b></p><p>
                                    

										•	Less expensive than mesh topology. Far less cabling is required in star topology.<br/>
										 

										•	Addition and deletion of a connection involve only one link, between device and hub.<br/>

										•	Robustness.<br/>

										•	Easy fault identification.

									</p>

									<p><b><u>Advantages of Star Topology:</u></b></p><p>•	Complete dependency on a single point, i.e. hub. If the hub goes down, the entire system goes down.<br/>

										•	Number of links required is still more than some other topologies.
										 </p>
								  <P><b><u>3.	Bus Topology:</u></b></P>
								  <p>Bus topology, unlike above mentioned topologies, is multipoint connection. A long cable acts as a backbone, in bus topology, to link all other nodes in the network. Nodes are connected to the bus by drop lines or taps. A drop line is a connection between the main cable and the device. A tap is a connector that splices into the main cable to create contact with the metallic core.</p>
								  <center><img src="pic/bus.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"/></center>
								  <p><b><u>Advantages of Bus Topology:</u></b></p>
								  <p>•	Ease of installation. It uses less cabling than star or mesh topology. The backbone cable stretches as far as the entire area, and the drop line has to reach only as far as the nearest point on the backbone cable.</p>
								  <p><b><u>Disadvantages of Bus Topology:</u></b></p>
								  <p>•	Difficult reconnection and fault-isolation. The distances in the bus topology are often chosen to optimise the requirements. Hence, it is difficult to add new devices.<br/>

									•	Fault or break in the backbone bus cable, stops all the transmissions.
									</p>

									<p><b><u>4. Ring Topology:</u></b></p>

									<p>As the name suggests, each device has a dedicated point to point link with 2 devices on either side of it, just like a ring (Recall that a cycle in a graph has degree 2 for each vertex). A signal is passed in one direction, from device to device until it reaches its final intended receiver. As the signal attenuates as it travels, each device is incorporated with a repeater for regenerating the signal to compensate for the loss of energy.</p>
									<center><img src="pic/ring.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"/></center>
									<p><b><u>Advantages of Ring Topology:</u></b></p>
									<p>•	Easy to install and reconfigure. Addition or deletion of a device requires changing of only 2 connections.<br/>

•	Fault isolation is easy. If one device does not receive the signal within its intended period of time, it can issue an alarm to alert the network operator.
</p>

                                     <p><b><u>Disadvantages of Bus Topology:</u></b></p>
                                     <p>•	Unidirectional traffic may lead to starvation.<br/>

•	A break in the ring can disable the entire network. (solved by using a dual ring)
</p>


<p><b><u>5.	Hybrid Topology:</u></b></p>
<P>Using more than one topology to optimise the requirement is known as hybrid topology.</P>
